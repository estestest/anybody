ANYBODY, is a fascinating journey to make you conscious about datas and facts of your body.It's a visualization that translate informations in a way to make it graspable
A project born to translate into interactions curious facts and datas of your bodies. Through three differents interactions, the user will discover the different rythms, components lenghts and speeds that we are able to reach. The first page is called SYMPHONY, a rythm  that our body perpetually repeat every minute, every second to keep us alive, that the user has to follow on time interacting with the keyboard.
The second page called FAR AWAY, let the user discover the lenghts of body components as the DNA …..... scrolling with the mouse the screen. The distance are compared to the distance from milan to pluto in order to let the user understand easily the scale. 
Finally HIGHWAY visualise the speeds of daily actions as …...... 




Each interaction as been a challenge to translate into javaScript, trying to get the better user interface with the few notions of coding we had. In the symphony code, our main challenge have been to create the animation at the right time according to the right rythm and the keyboard. Using the millis() we could define the rythm according to the real body rythm and mixing it the the Keypressed function we solved the problem of coordination between the user actions and the real moment of action.

Far away _ the challenge was to create the scrolling effect and to transmit the informations to the user in the right way. That s why we created a zoom effect only when the user pass hover the graphic elements in order to let him understand what it is. A graphic scale on the bottom is there to give him a reference about the distance achieved. The both right and left sides are the areas where , when the mouse is inside, able the user to scroll in a side or in an other , with two differents speeds.

Highway_The challenge of this interaction wasto to choose the right way to connect the interaction of the user and the data to comunicate , in an easy, intuitive and connected interaction.
The user as to reach the right speed and release the mouse at that time to achieve the action and visualise the animation that will display wich daily action reach this speed.On this code we used a piece of code already existing to create the graphic animation behind the illustration.


We had some difficulties on the final part, trying to combine all the interactions together and creating an interface able to explain the project and display it. Creating the home page in HTML was an other challenge, discovering this other language and trying to obtain the result we wanted.


The code we re-used _______ from ______
